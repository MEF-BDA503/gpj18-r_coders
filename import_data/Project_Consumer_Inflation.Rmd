## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r consumer inflation}
#Download Raw Data
# Create a temporary file
tmp<-tempfile(fileext=".xlsx")
# Download file from repository to the temp file
download.file("https://github.com/MEF-BDA503/gpj18-r_coders/blob/master/import_data/Consumer_Inflation.xlsx?raw=true",mode="wb",destfile=tmp)
# Read that excel file using readxl package's read_excel function. You might need to adjust the parameters (skip, col_names) according to your raw file's format.
raw_data<-readxl::read_excel(tmp,skip=7,col_names=FALSE)
# Remove the temp file
file.remove(tmp)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
raw_data <- raw_data %>%
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
#In order to make the data standardized and workable we need to define column names and remove NA values for this example. 
#Please use the same column names in your examples also.
# Use the same column names in your data.
colnames(raw_data) <- c("Date","Consumer_Price_Index_Yearly_Change_%","Consumer_Price_Index_Montly_Change_%")
# Now we replace NA values with 0 and label the time period with year and month, so when we merge the data we won't be confused.
Consumer_Inflation<- raw_data 

print(Consumer_Inflation,width=Inf)
```
```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
saveRDS(Consumer_Inflation, file = "Consumer_Inflation.rds")
```
